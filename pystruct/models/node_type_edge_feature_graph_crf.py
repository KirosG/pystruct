    """
    Pairwise CRF with features/strength associated to each edge and different types of nodes

    Pairwise potentials are asymmetric and shared over all edges of same type.
    They are weighted by an edge-specific features, though.
    This allows for contrast sensitive potentials or directional potentials
    (using a {-1, +1} encoding of the direction for example).

    More complicated interactions are also possible, of course.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n_types : number of node types
    
    l_n_states : list of int, default=None
        Number of states per type of variables. 

    l_n_features : list of int, default=None
        Number of features per type of node. 

    a_n_edge_features: an array of shape (n_types, n_types) given the number of features as a function of the node types
    
    NOTE: there should always be at least 1 feature for any pairs of types with some edge of that type in the graph.
    Said differently, if you put 0 somewhere in that matrix, do not create any egde corresponding to that type of edge!!  
    
    class_weight : None, or list of array-like
        Class weights. If a list of array-like is passed, the Ith one must have length equal to l_n_states[i]
        None means equal class weights (across node types)


    X and Y
    -------
    Node features are given as a list of n_types arrays of shape (n_type_nodes, n_type_features):
        - n_type_nodes is the number of nodes of that type
        - n_type_features is the number of features for this type of node
    
    Edges are given as a list of n_types x n_types arrays of shape (n_type_edges, 2). 
        Columns are resp.: node index (in corresponding node type), node index (in corresponding node type)
    
    Edge features are given as a list of n_types x n_types arrays of shape (n_type_type_edge, n_type_type_edge_features)
        - n_type_type_edge is the number of edges of type type_type
        - n_type_type_edge_features is the number of features for edge of type type_type
        
    An instance ``X`` is represented as a tuple ``([node_features, ..], [edges, ..], [edge_features, ..])`` 

    Labels ``Y`` are given as one array of shape (n_nodes)   The meaning of a label depends upon the node type.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : tuple
            Instance of a graph with unary evidence.
            x=(unaries, edges)
            unaries are an nd-array of shape (n_nodes, n_features),
            edges are an nd-array of shape (n_edges, 2)

        y : ndarray, shape (n_nodes,)
            Ground truth labeling relative to which the loss
            will be measured.

        w : ndarray, shape=(size_joint_feature,)
            Parameters for the CRF energy function.

        relaxed : bool, default=False
            Whether relaxed inference should be performed.
            Only meaningful if inference method is 'lp' or 'ad3'.
            By default fractional solutions are rounded. If relaxed=True,
            fractional solutions are returned directly.

        return_energy : bool, default=False
            Whether to return the energy of the solution (x, y) that was found.

        Returns
        -------
        y_pred : ndarray or tuple
            By default an inter ndarray of shape=(n_nodes)
            of variable assignments for x is returned.
            If ``relaxed=True`` and inference_method is ``lp`` or ``ad3``,
            a tuple (unary_marginals, pairwise_marginals)
            containing the relaxed inference result is returned.
            unary marginals is an array of shape (n_nodes, n_states),
            pairwise_marginals is an array of
            shape (n_states, n_states) of accumulated pairwise marginals.
